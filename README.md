# Exercise Tracker App

This project was created to learn how to create an end-to-end application and how to integrate the frontend with the backend. It was created solely for the purpose of learning a new techology so that I can work on more complex applications in the future. 

I learned how to create the `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` API endpoints to perform the `CRUD` operations on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?utm_campaign=atlas_bc_mern&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=inf&utm_term=campaign_term&utm_content=campaign_content). I also learned how to connect the frontend with the backend and send the relevant request to the API using `axios`. 

I followed the MERN tutorial provided by [Freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org). The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M)

If you want to continue working on the completed application, you may clone this repo by forking it and then executing a `git clone <YOUR-REPO-URL-HERE>`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
