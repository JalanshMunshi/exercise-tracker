#Exercise Tracker App

This project was created to learn how to create an end-to-end application and how to integrate the frontend with the backend. It was created solely for the purpose of learning a new techology so that I can work on more complex applications in the future. 

If you want to continue working on the completed application, you may clone this repo by forking it and then executing a `git clone <YOUR-REPO-URL-HERE>.

---------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
